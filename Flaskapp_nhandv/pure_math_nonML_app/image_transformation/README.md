In this section, we will apply the fundamental transformation like `cosine, sine, tanh, polynomial, logarithm, etc` to transform the input

    - template
    | - index.html  # main page of web app (to upload and display the transformation result)
    | - notfound.html  # if the uploaded file is not accepted

    - static
    |- input.png  # data that saved from the uploaded image 
    |- output.csv  # data to process / transformed
    
    - run.py  # Flask file that runs app
    - transformed.py # contains all the libraries and class
